Java Quacking Roadmap
=====================

These are the features planned for the Java Quacking library up to the 1.0 
version. When the library reaches that version number then it's free for
all and features will be implemented as the wind blows under the wings of
quacking ducks.

Version 1.0
-----------

  * Compile with Java 8 only.

Version 0.8
-----------

  * Allow before, after and around methods before dispatch.

Version 0.7
-----------

  * Allow to curry implementation methods. A call for method A with N arguments
    can be implemented by a method B with more arguments.

Version 0.6
-----------

  * Allow to rename calls. Calling method named A can actually call method
    named B in the implementation.
