Java Quacking Roadmap
=====================

These are the features planned for the Java Quacking library up to the 1.0 
version. When the library reaches that version number then it's free for
all and features will be implemented as the wind blows under the wings of
quacking ducks.

Version 1.0
-----------

  * Compile with Java 8 only.
